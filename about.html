    <h1>About Panjab University</h1>
    <div class="main-container">
      <div class="second content">
        The layout of two campuses of the University has been conceived to meet
        the academic, administrative, sports/recreational, residential and other
        requirements of a growing University. To make it self-contained,
        infrastructural facilities like its own Shopping Centre, Health Centre,
        Bank, Post office, Swimming Pool, Gymnasium, Sports Grounds, Botanical
        Gardens, well maintained parks, Open Air Theatre, Guest Houses, Faculty
        House, Seminar Complexes, Alumni House, Community Centre and a school,
        have been provided. Besides these facilities, the University Campus has
        8 hostels for boys, 9 hostels for girls, a Working Women Hostel and 2
        sports hostels.

        A cluster of prominent buildings like the Gandhi Bhawan, the Fine Arts
        Museum, the University Library and the Student Centre form the hub of
        social interaction. The three-winged structure of the Gandhi Bhawan,
        considered the pride of the University, is its most artistic building.
        The Fine Arts Museum, with its series of small galleries arranged around
        a courtyard, each gallery having a hyperbolic paraboloid roof (umbrella
        shaped), is not only an architectural but a structural marvel as well.
        The University Library, another key building, in the Sector 14 Campus is
        an RCC framed structure with red sandstone veneers. The Student Centre,
        with its circular base and a ramp pulsating around its cylindrical body,
        is another landmark building.

        Chandigarh, the dream city of India’s first Prime Minister, Sh. Jawahar
        Lal Nehru, was planned by the famous French architect Le Corbusier.
        Picturesquely located at the foothills of Shivaliks, it is known as one
        of the best experiments in urban planning and modern architecture in the
        twentieth century in India.Chandigarh derives its name from the temple
        of “Chandi Mandir” located in the vicinity of the site selected for the
        city. The deity ‘Chandi’, the goddess of power and a fort of ‘garh’
        laying beyond the temple gave the city its name “Chandigarh-The City
        Beautiful”.

        In March, 1948, the Government of Punjab, in consultation with the
        Government of India, approved the area of the foothills of the Shivaliks
        as the site for the new capital. The location of the city site was a
        part of the erstwhile Ambala district as per the 1892-93 gazetteer of
        District Ambala. The foundation stone of the city was laid in 1952.
        Subsequently, at the time of reorganization of the state on 01.11.1966
        into Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pardesh, the city assumed the unique
        distinction of being the capital city of both, Punjab and Haryana while
        it itself was declared as a Union Territory and under the direct control
        of the Central Government.
        <br /><br />
        The Union Territory of Chandigarh is located in the foothills of the
        Shivalik hill ranges in the north, which form a part of the fragile
        Himalayan ecosystem. It is occupied by Kandi (Bhabhar) in the north east
        and Sirowal (Tarai) and alluvial plains in the remaining part. The
        subsurface formation comprises of beds of boulders, pebbles, gravel,
        sand, silt, clays and some kankar. The area is drained by two seasonal
        rivulets viz. Sukhna Choe in the east and Patiala-Ki-Rao Choe in the
        west. The central part forms a surface water divide and has two minor
        streams. The stream passing through the central part is called N-Choe
        and the other is Choe Nala which initiates at Sector 29.
